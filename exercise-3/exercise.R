# Load R's "USPersonalExpenditure" dataset using the "data()" function
# This will produce a data frame called `USPersonalExpenditure`

# it's not a data frame (it's actually what is called a matrix)
# Test this using the `is.data.frame()` function

# to the `data.frame()` function to convert it a data farm. Do this, storing the
# result in a new variable

# Why are they so strange? Think about whether you could use a number like 1940
# with dollar notation!

# What are the row names of your dataframe?

us.exp$category <- rownames(us.exp)

# What was the highest expenditure category in 1960?
# Hint: use the `max()` function to find the largest, then compare that to the column
highest.1960 <- us.exp$category[us.exp$X1960 == max(us.exp$X1960)]

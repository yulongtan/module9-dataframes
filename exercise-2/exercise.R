### Retrieve values from your data frame to answer the following questions
### Note that you should get the value as specific as possible (e.g., a single
### cell rather than the whole row!)
View(salaries)

# What was the 2015 salary of employee 57
salaries[salaries$employees == "Employee 57", "salaries.2015"]

# How many employees got a raise?
length(salaries$got.raise[salaries$got.raise])

# What was the value of the highest raise?
max.salary <- max(salaries$raise)

# What was the "name" of the employee who received the highest raise?
print(salaries[salaries$raise == max.salary, "employees"])

# What was the largest decrease in salaries between the two years?
min.salary <- min(salaries$raise)

# What was the name of the employee who recieved largest decrease in salary?
print(salaries[salaries$raise == min.salary, "employees"])
# What was the average salary increase?
print(mean(salaries$raise))

### Bonus ###

# Write a .csv file of your salaries to your working directory


# For people who did not get a raise, how much money did they lose?


# Is that what you expected them to lose based on how you generated their salaries?

# Exercise 6: Husky Football 2015 Season
# Read in the Husky Football 2015 game data into a variable called `husky.games.2015`



# Create a vector of the teams that the Huskies played against during that season



# Create a vector of the their final scores for the games
# Call this variable `husky.scores`



# Create 2 variables called `rushing.yards` and `passing.yards` to represent the yards the Huskies rushed and passed



# Create a variable called `combined.yards` that is the total yardage of the Huskies for each game



# Add the `combined.yards` vector to the dataframe with the column name being `combined`



# Write the dataframe to a new `.csv` file called `huskies_2015_improved.csv` into the `data directory`



# What is the score of the game where the Huskies had the most combined yards?



# Define a function `MostYardsScore` that takes in an argument `games` (a data frame) and
# returns a descriptive sentence about the game that was played that had the most yards scored in it.



# Challenge!
# What was the highest yardage game so far this season?
# Hint: Read in the dataset titled `huskies_2016.csv` and save it as a variable

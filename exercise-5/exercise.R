# Exercise 5: Popular Baby Names Over Time

# Read in the female baby names csv file into a variable called `female.names`
female.names <- read.csv('data/female_names.csv', stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

# Create a vector `years` as the year column of the dataset
years <- female.names$year

# Create a vector `names` as the name column of the datset
names <- female.names$name

# Create a vector `props` as the proportion column of the dataset
props <- female.names$prop

# Create a vector `names.2013` as your names vector where your years vector is 2013
names.2013 <- names[years == 2013]

# Create a vector `prop.2013` as the your props vector where your years vecctor is 2013
proportion.2013 <- props[years==2013]

# What was the most popular female name in 2013?
most.pop <- names.2013[proportion.2013 == max(proportion.2013)]

# Write a funciton `most.popular` that takes in a value `my.year`, and returns
# a sentence stating the most popular name in that year. Note how you had to make intermediary variables above.
MostPopular <- function(my.year) {
  year.tmp <- years[years == my.year]
  names.tmp <- names[years == my.year]
  prop.tmp <- props[years==my.year]
  most.pop <- names.tmp[prop.tmp == max(prop.tmp[year.tmp == my.year])]
  return(paste('The most popular baby name in', my.year, 'was', most.pop))
}

# What was the most popular female name in 1994?
most.pop.1994 <- MostPopular(1994)


### Bonus ###

# Write a function `how.popular` that takes in a name and a year, and returns
# a sentence with how popular that name was in that year
HowPopular <- function(my.name, my.year) {
  names.tmp <- names[years == my.year]
  prop.tmp <- props[years==my.year]
  popular <- round(prop.tmp[names.tmp == my.name], 4)*100
  return(paste('The proportion of people named', my.name, 'in', my.year, 'was', popular))
}

# How popular was the name 'Laura' in 1995
HowPopular('Laura', 1995)

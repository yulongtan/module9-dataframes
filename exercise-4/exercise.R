# Exercise 4: Gates Foundation Educational Grants

# Read the data from the `data/gates_money.csv` file into a variable called
# `grants` using the `read.csv()` function
# Be sure to set your working directory, and do NOT treat strings as factors!


# Use the View function to look at the loaded data


# Create a variable `organization` as the `organizationtotal.amount` column of the dataset


# Confirm that the "organization" column is a vector using the `is.vector()`
# This is a useful debugging tip if you hit errors later!


### Now you can ask some more interesting questions about the dataset.  Store your answers in variables ###

# What was the mean grant value?


# What was the dollar amount of the largest grant?


# What was the dollar amount of the smallest grant?


# Which organization received the largest grant?


# Which organization received the smallest grant?


# How many grants were awarded in 2010?s

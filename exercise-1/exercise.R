# Exercise 1: Creating data frames

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks scored in each game this
# season (google "Seahawks" for the info!)
seahawks.points <- c(20, 31, 31, 26, 5, 40, 10, 24, 31, 25, 26, 20)

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahwaks have allowed to be scored
# against them in each game this season
enemy.points <- c(25, 25, 24, 15, 14, 7, 38, 3, 34, 23, 6, 36)

# Combine your two vectors into a dataframe
scoreboard <- data.frame(seahawks.points, enemy.points)

# Create a new column "diff" that is the difference in points.
# Hint: recall the syntax for assigning new elements (which in this case will be
# a vector) to a list!
scoreboard$diff <- seahawks.points - enemy.points

# Create a new column "won" which is TRUE if the Seahawks won
scoreboard$won <- seahawks.points > enemy.points

# Create a vector of the opponent names corresponding to the games played
other.teams <- c("Saints", "Bills", "Patriots", "Eagles", "Buccaneers", "Panthers", "Packers", "Rams", "Cardinals", "49ers", "Lions", "Falcons")


# Assign your dataframe rownames of their opponents
scoreboard$opponent <- other.teams

# View your data frame to see how it has changed!
View(scoreboard)
